Subject to antitrust review and closing of the purchase, Merck holds 64.5% of the capital of Serono and 75.5% of the voting rights, for which Merck agreed to pay CHF 1,100 per share in cash. Merck will make a public tender offer under Swiss law for the same price of CHF 1,100 per share. The offer price represents a 20% premium to the share price as of September 20, 2006, and a total equity value of CHF 16.6 billion (approximately EUR 10.6 billion) on a fully diluted basis. "This acquisition transforms Merck's Pharmaceuticals business and creates a leading position in the world of biologic medicines, which helps to ensure its future through the 21st century," said Michael Roemer, Chairman of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA. "Both companies have a unique opportunity to achieve a competitive advantage through a combined EUR 1 billion R&D budget and a stronger product portfolio. The companies are a perfect fit with 28 compounds in development. Together with Serono management and employees, we will create a world-class biopharmaceutical company with global footprint, cutting-edge biotechnology manufacturing and strong growth." Ernesto Bertarelli said: "With this transaction we create a combined business with strong capabilities, especially in neurology and oncology. Together with Serono, Merck will be a world-class biotechnology company and a major player in the global pharmaceutical market. This match will allow Serono's innovative biotech abilities to play an important role in the future of the combined company while expanding its global reach."Strategic Rationale Together with Serono, Merck achieves: Critical mass in R&D with an annual budget of approximately EUR 1 billion R&D capabilities greater than the sum of the parts Market-leading Multiple Sclerosis franchise to broaden business portfolio Expanded geographic reach and access to the U.S. market World-class biotechnology manufacturing Merck-Serono Biopharmaceuticals Merck's Pharma Ethicals division will be combined with Serono to create "Merck-Serono Biopharmaceuticals." The headquarters of this business will be in Geneva, Switzerland. Merck-Serono Biopharmaceuticals' U.S. headquarters will be in Boston, MA. Based on 2005 figures, the new Merck Group would have pro-forma sales of EUR 7.7 billion, including EUR 3.6 billion in biopharmaceutical sales. The Merck Group will have a total number of about 35,000 employees. Merck's successful business model of competing in both pharmaceuticals and chemicals will remain in place and be strengthened by this combination. Strong financial profile and significant value creation  The acquisition will be funded initially through existing Merck cash and a bridge financing. The all-cash transaction will be refinanced through a combination of a syndicated loan, a bond and a capital increase of EUR 2 to 2.5 billion, in which the Merck Family will participate with an amount of up to EUR 1 billion. Merck is committed to retaining its investment-grade rating and expects a rapid deleveraging driven by a strong operating cash flow. Merck expects the transaction will have a positive impact on adjusted earnings per share (before transaction related charges and one time restructuring costs). Offer Details The offer is subject to the customary conditions, including the receipt of antitrust clearances and the closing of the transaction with the Bertarelli family. Full details of the conditions will be disclosed in the offer document. The transaction is expected to close in early 2007.

"4"	"BRISTOL, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 7, 2006--King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE: KG - News) announced today it has entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement and related agreements with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND - News) to acquire rights to AVINZA® (morphine sulfate extended release). AVINZA® is an extended release formulation of morphine and is indicated as a once-daily treatment for moderate-to-severe pain in patients who require continuous, around-the-clock opioid therapy for an extended period of time. Over 50 million people are affected by severe chronic pain in the United States, including low back pain, osteoarthritis, cancer related pain, and neuropathic pain. Due largely to the aging population, better physician training in pain management, and patient demand for better control, opioid sales are rising and are expected to exceed $7 billion in 2009 according to Frost and Sullivan, a leading global source for market research reports. Retail sales of AVINZA® totaled approximately $179 million in 2005 according to IMS Health Incorporated data. Brian A. Markison, King's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "This transaction is an important step in the execution of our strategic plan. AVINZA® is a perfect complement to our growing neuroscience portfolio. Furthermore, we believe that AVINZA® will provide significant and sustainable revenue." Between today and closing, King will market AVINZA® under the terms of a separate contract sales force agreement together with the experienced Ligand sales force that currently promotes the product. Upon closing of the asset purchase agreement, King will integrate a large portion of Ligand's existing AVINZA® sales force, nearly doubling the capacity of King's current neuroscience specialty sales team. Additionally, one of King's two primary care sales forces will market AVINZA®. Mr. Markison continued, "AVINZA® strengthens our pain franchise and better establishes King as a leader in pain management. Importantly, developing even greater relationships today with prescribing physicians will further enhance the market potential of REMOXY(TM) (long-acting oral oxycodone), our lead abuse-deterrent opioid product currently in late-stage development with Pain Therapeutics, Inc. Today's announcement underscores King's commitment to building a stronger, more stable company well-positioned to create value for its shareholders." Following approval of REMOXY(TM) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), King's portfolio of products will include a broader spectrum of pain management solutions to meet the needs of different patient populations. AVINZA®: Typically prescribed by oncology and pain management specialists, it is ideally suited for low-risk patient populations with chronic moderate-to-severe pain. REMOXY(TM): Like AVINZA®, REMOXY(TM) is intended for patients with moderate-to-severe pain. However, King expects that it will be prescribed by a broader range of physicians for a wide variety of pain management conditions due to its abuse-deterrent formulation of long-acting oxycodone, which is intended to minimize the risk of drug diversion, abuse or accidental misuse for patients. SKELAXIN® (metaxalone): A non-narcotic and non-addictive muscle relaxant that brings relief to muscle regions affected by pain and discomfort, especially lower back pain. SKELAXIN® is often prescribed concomitantly with analgesics such as AVINZA®. About the Agreements Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement King will make a $265 million payment to Ligand to acquire all the rights to AVINZA® in the United States, its territories and Canada. In addition, King will also assume a product related liability owed a third party totaling $48 million and all existing product royalty obligations. In addition to existing royalty obligations, King will pay Ligand a 15 percent royalty during the first 20 months after the closing date. Subsequent royalty payments will be based upon calendar year net sales. If calendar year net sales are less than $200 million the royalty payment will be 5 percent of all net sales. If calendar year net sales are greater than $200 million then the royalty payment will be 10 percent of all net sales less than $250 million, plus 15 percent of net sales greater than $250 million. The agreement is subject to customary regulatory approvals, including antitrust review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The transaction is also conditioned upon the approval of Ligand's shareholders. King anticipates that the transaction will close by the end of this year. Between today and closing, King's primary care and neuroscience sales forces will market AVINZA® in the United States pursuant to the terms of a separate contract sales force agreement. Under the terms of that agreement, Ligand will pay King a customary fee for each detail of the product performed by King's sales force. Ligand will retain control over all marketing plans and maintain all regulatory filings with the FDA for AVINZA ® during this interim period. Citigroup acted as the financial advisor to King on this transaction. About AVINZA® AVINZA® is an extended-release opioid agent for patients requiring continuous, around-the-clock analgesia for an extended period of time. It is ideally suited for low-risk populations for the treatment of cancer and severe, chronic non-malignant pain conditions. It contains morphine in an extended release form, allowing for once-daily dosing. AVINZA® is covered by a formulation patent that extends through November 2017. Because AVINZA® is an extended-release product, it should not be chewed, crushed, or dissolved due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine. AVINZA® should not be taken with alcohol or drug products containing alcohol. The most common serious adverse events reported with administration of AVINZA® are vomiting, nausea, death, dehydration, dyspnea, and sepsis. AVINZA® is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to morphine, morphine salts, or any components of the product. About King Pharmaceuticals King, headquartered in Bristol, Tennessee, is a vertically integrated branded pharmaceutical company. King, an S&P 500 Index company, seeks to capitalize on opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry through the development, including through in-licensing arrangements and acquisitions, of novel branded prescription pharmaceutical products in attractive markets and the strategic acquisition of branded products that can benefit from focused promotion and marketing and product life-cycle management.

"10"	"LONDON, PHILADELPHIA and LIBERTY CORNER, N.J., Nov. 21 /PRNewswire- FirstCall/ -- GlaxoSmithKline and Reliant Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced today that they had reached an agreement under which Reliant will be acquired by GSK for $1.65 billion (800 million pounds Sterling) in cash. Reliant, a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company focused on cardiovascular therapies, recorded net sales of $341 million in the nine months ending September 30, 2007, an increase of 62% over the comparable time period a year earlier.GSK expects the transaction will be slightly accretive to earnings in 2008, excluding integration costs, and will create additional value in following years. Through its strategic in-licensing and development strategy, Reliant has developed a portfolio of specialty medicines combating heart disease, including US rights to Lovaza(TM) (omega-3-acid ethyl esters), a treatment for adult patients with very high levels of triglycerides. Triglycerides are fatty substances in the blood associated with increased risks of coronary artery disease. Lovaza is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adults with very high (greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels. High lipid levels continue to be a growing health problem in the United States, with up to 5 million people having triglyceride levels classified as very high. Lovaza is the only prescription omega-3 medicine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of very high triglycerides, and remains the only omega-3 medicine that, along with diet and exercise, has been clinically proven to provide a 45% reduction in triglycerides in adult patients with very high triglyceride levels. Launched in late 2005, Lovaza (formerly known as Omacor(R)) achieved rapid uptake among patients and health care professionals. In the nine months ending September 30, 2007, net sales were $206 million, an increase of 115% over the first nine months of 2006. Lovaza competes in the non-statin dyslipidemia segment of the US cardiovascular market, where it had achieved a 10% market share of total prescriptions as of September 30, 2007. Sales in the non-statin dyslipidemia market totaled approximately $2.2 billion in 2006 and are expected to grow in excess of 20% a year. GSK believes there is significant opportunity for future growth of Lovaza in this market segment. Reliant licensed the rights to Lovaza in the US and Puerto Rico from Pronova BioPharma ASA , a publicly traded Norwegian company that will continue to supply the product's primary material. Rights to Lovaza in other markets have been licensed by Pronova to several other companies. Commenting on the acquisition agreement, Chris Viehbacher, President, US Pharmaceuticals, GSK, said, "The addition of Lovaza to the GSK portfolio adds a new driver of sales growth in the US business. It represents a strong strategic fit, complementing Coreg CR(R), a leading treatment for heart failure and hypertension, and adds to our growing profile in the cardiovascular disease area." "Today is a momentous date for Reliant," said Bradley T. Sheares, CEO of Reliant. "We are very proud of the work that our employees have done to build this company, particularly the energy and perseverance of our sales teams, who have demonstrated their worth in building a formidable Lovaza franchise in less than 24 months. We see great additional potential through this acquisition for Lovaza and the patients who could benefit from it." The acquisition is subject to approval by the US Federal Trade Commission and is expected to conclude before year-end. In addition to Lovaza, Reliant Pharmaceuticals, based in Liberty Corner, NJ, currently markets three other in-licensed cardiovascular products - high blood pressure treatments DynaCirc CR(R) (isradipine) and InnoPran XL(R) (propanolol HCl), as well as Rythmol SR(R) (propafenone), which treats abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmia.

"13"	"Celgene to Buy Pharmion Corporation for $2.9 Billion SUMMIT, N.J. & BOULDER, Colo. -- Celgene CorporationÂ and Pharmion Corporation today jointly announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Celgene has agreed to acquire Pharmion. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Celgene will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pharmion common stock for $72.00 per share payable in a combination of cash and shares of Celgene common stock. The transaction is expected to be slightly dilutive to earnings in 2008 and accretive in 2009 and beyond. The acquisition of Pharmion furthers Celgeneâ€™s strategy to become a global leader in the hematology/oncology field. The transaction brings together three medically meaningful therapies, RevlimidÂ®, ThalomidÂ® and VidazaÂ®, treating different patient populations worldwide. These products are expected to generate multiple global revenue streams for accelerated revenue and earnings growth over the next five years. â€œThe acquisition of Pharmion is an exceptional strategic fit that will expand our role as a leader in hematology and oncology,â€ said Sol J. Barer, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. â€œOur combined global infrastructure will leverage the therapeutic and commercial potential of Pharmionâ€™s products, particularly Vidaza, which has the potential to become a major global therapy. By bringing together the talents and resources of both companies, we move closer to our vision of becoming a leading hematology and oncology company in the world, expanding our industry leading programs for safety, access and patient support.â€ Pharmion is a global drug development company that has built a successful and promising oncology franchise. Pharmion has four products on the market and several in development focused on hematological and solid tumor cancers. Vidaza is approved in the U.S. for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Vidaza has demonstrated unprecedented overall survival benefit for higher-risk MDS patients based on a Phase III trial. Pharmion previously reported that its Phase III study demonstrated that Vidaza extended overall survival by 74 percent as compared to conventional care regimens. Patients receiving Vidaza had a two-year survival rate of 50.8 percent versus 26.2 percent for those in the comparator arm. These results translated into a median survival benefit of 9.4 months (24.4 months versus 15.0 months). Pharmion expects to file a Market Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe for Vidaza in higher-risk MDS before the end of the year. Additionally, thalidomide (licensed to Pharmion by Celgene to develop and commercialize in Europe and other select countries) is under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) as a therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. An EMEA action is expected in late 2007 to early 2008. Pharmionâ€™s clinical development pipeline includes Amrubicin, a third generation synthetic anthracycline, which is in Phase III development for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) under an approved Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). MGCD0103, a selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor is being evaluated in Phase II studies in hematological malignancies as well as in solid tumors. â€œThe combination of our two product portfolios and organizations represents the opportunity to create a leading global hematology/oncology company,â€ said Patrick J. Mahaffy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pharmion Corporation. â€œIn particular, I would like to thank the Pharmion employees who have contributed so much to the development of our company and to ensuring that our products are available to improve the lives of cancer patients in the US, Europe, and many international markets. We believe that Celgene is now exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of these efforts, as well as those of its own strong organization, to create a truly unique global biopharmaceutical company.â€ Terms of the Transaction The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of the acquisition by stockholders of Pharmion and receipt of antitrust clearances. Celgene and Pharmion expect the transaction to close by the end of the second quarter of 2008. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Pharmion common stock will be exchanged for $25.00 in cash and shares of Celgene common stock in an amount to be determined by an exchange ratio. If the volume weighted average price per share of Celgene common stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the merger (the â€œVWAP Closing Priceâ€) is between $56.15 and $72.93, then the exchange ratio will be equal to $47.00 divided by the VWAP Closing Price. If the VWAP Closing Price is less than $56.15, Pharmion stockholders will receive 0.8370 Celgene shares for each share of Pharmion common stock, and if the VWAP Closing Price is greater than $72.93, Pharmion stockholders will receive 0.6445 Celgene shares for each share of Pharmion common stock.

"16"	"EXTON, Pa., Oct. 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ViroPharma Incorporated today announced it has completed its acquisition of Lev Pharmaceuticals following the approval earlier today of the transaction by Lev stockholders. Lev stockholders will receive $2.25 in cash, 0.042146 shares of ViroPharma common stock and one non- transferable contingent value right which entitles the holder to receive up to two contingent payments of $0.50 each in cash, payable upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones, for each share of Lev common stock that they own. The total number of ViroPharma shares to be issued as part of the merger consideration is 7,286,286. With the acquisition of Lev Pharmaceuticals, ViroPharma takes a significant step in broadening its portfolio of treatments for significant unmet medical needs, by acquiring Cinryze C1 esterase inhibitor (human), which recently received marketing approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Hereditary angioedema, or C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency, is a dangerous and potentially deadly inflammatory disease affecting up to 10,000 patients in the United States, caused by a genetic deficiency in an essential protein called C1 esterase inhibitor. Clinical studies have shown that prophylactic use of Cinryze, which increases the levels of C1 esterase inhibitor in the bloodstream, can significantly reduce the severity, duration and frequency of HAE attacks. Separately, ViroPharma announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted seven years of marketing exclusivity to Cinryze C1 inhibitor (human) for routine prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema (HAE) pursuant to the Orphan Drug Act. Lev originally received orphan drug designation for Cinryze by the Office of Orphan Products Development on July 16, 2004. "We are extremely excited to receive the grant of seven years of market exclusivity for Cinryze in prophylaxis against HAE, and to complete this acquisition; we now turn our attention to finalizing a robust patient access program and launching Cinryze into the HAE prophylaxis market," commented Vincent Milano, ViroPharma's president and chief executive officer. "Cinryze is not only a life-saving therapy treating a very dangerous disease, but also a product capable of significantly improving the everyday lives of patients. We are committed to the launch, and to ensuring that patients around the country suffering from this debilitating disease have access to the drug." "We are pleased that we have completed this acquisition by ViroPharma and are confident in their commitment to ensuring that all patients who need access to Cinryze will have access to this life-saving therapy," commented Judson Cooper, Lev's former chairman of the board. "This transaction provides our stockholders with attractive financial terms, through the upfront payment and the opportunity to continue to share in the success of the drug through the ownership of ViroPharma shares and the contingent value rights." Share exchange information and a letter of transmittal will be emailed to Lev stockholders shortly. If you have any questions, please contact ViroPharma's exchange agent, StockTrans, at (800) 733-1121.

About Cinryze C1 Inhibitor (human) Cinryze is a highly purified, pasteurized and nanofiltered plasma-derived C1 inhibitor product that has been approved by FDA for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE. C1 inhibitor therapy has been used acutely for more than 30 years in Europe to treat patients with C1 inhibitor deficiency. In the Phase 3 prophylactic treatment trial, Cinryze significantly decreased the number of HAE attacks compared to placebo. The trial had a crossover design with 22 subjects in the efficacy data set. The difference between the number of angioedema attacks during treatment with Cinryze and the number during treatment with placebo was statistically significant (p<0.0001). During 12 weeks of prophylactic treatment with Cinryze, the number of attacks per patient ranged from 0 to 17 with a mean of 6.1 and a median of 6 attacks. During 12 weeks of treatment with placebo, the number of attacks per patient ranged from 6 to 22 with a mean of 12.7 and a median of 13.5 attacks. The clinically and statistically significant results for the primary endpoint demonstrating the efficacy of Cinryze were supported by statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences in all of the secondary endpoints, with Cinryze demonstrating reductions in the severity and duration of attacks and the number of days of swelling. Cinryze has been well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions observed have been upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, rash and headache. No drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) have been observed in clinical trials. Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Thrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving high dose off-label C1 inhibitor therapy well above the approved treatment dosage regimen. With any blood or plasma derived product, there may be a risk of transmission of infectious agents, e.g. viruses and, theoretically, the CJD agent. The risk has been reduced by screening patients for prior exposure to certain virus infections and by manufacturing steps to reduce the risk of viral transmission including pasteurization and nanofiltration. Cinryze is for intravenous use only. A dose of 1000 Units Cinryze can be administered every 3 or 4 days for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in HAE patients. Cinryze is administered at an injection rate of 1 mL per minute. About Hereditary Angioedema HAE is the result of a defect in the gene controlling the synthesis of C1 inhibitor. C1 inhibitor maintains the natural regulation of the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems, that when left unrestricted, can initiate or perpetuate an attack by consuming the already low levels of endogenous C1 inhibitor in HAE patients.

Acanya(TM) is expected to be launched in the United States in early 2009. Dow has products in clinical development for the treatment of rosacea, moderate to severe acne, fungal infections and common warts. We expect one or more products to enter a Phase III trial in 2009, with an expected launch as early as 2012. In addition, Dow operates a well-regarded topical products services business dedicated to working with external sponsors for the formulation and development of topical therapies. Under the terms of the agreement, Valeant will pay Dow $285 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. Approximately $8 million in cash will be retained from current Dow accounts, making the net amount paid $277 million.

We believe this expansion of our product line has significant growth potential because of the therapeutic value of the Indevus product portfolio, the unique expertise of both companies, and the demographic, health care and reimbursement trends that favor the consideration of new products to address unmet needs in urology and endocrinology."These trends demand that pharmaceutical companies become better health care partners with physicians and managed care organizations by offering a range of new products and technologies in related medical specialties that achieve better outcomes for patients. This transaction represents a unique opportunity for us to achieve these goals. The combined company will market nine products through three specialty sales forces and have the capability to develop innovative new therapies using a novel drug delivery technology. We believe this will make Endo a stronger competitor, a more valuable health care supplier and a more successful company."Indevus chairman and chief executive officer, Glenn L. Cooper, M.D., stated, "This transaction allows us to capture significant value for our shareholders and create new value for patients, physicians and shareholders of both companies under Endo's leadership.
